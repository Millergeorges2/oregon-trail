This month, we're going to build the popular RPG from 1990, The Oregon Trail.  To set the scene, you're a pioneer ready to set out on the Oregon Trail.  With a head full of big dreams, and a pocket of cash, you've got some choices to make, and many more choices await along the way.  All of them affect your and your party's chances of making it all the way to Oregon City.  Will you succeed?  Its going to take a clear head, good decisions, and a fair bit of luck to make it through.  Safe Travels Homesteader!

### Description
As a covered wagon party of pioneers, you head out west from Independence, Missouri to the Willamette River and valley in Oregon. You first must stock up on provisions, and then, while traveling, make decisions such as when to rest, how much food to eat, etc. The Oregon Trail incorporates simulation elements and planning ahead, along with discovery and adventure, as well as mini-game-like activities (hunting and floating down the Dalles River).
